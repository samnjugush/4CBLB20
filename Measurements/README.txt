This file outlines the contents of each folder.
1. Controller FRF R:
- Contains the FRF measurements of the R axis WITH the controller implemented.
2. FRF R:
- Containts the FRF measurements of the R axis from the first experiment.
3. FRF X:
- Contains the FRF measurements of the X axis. It is recommended to use 
  the files named "sens2ol_X_number.fig", these were obtained from the 
  first measurement. The results from the second measurement were terrible
  for this axis, for some reason.
4. FRF Z:
- Contains the FRF measurements of the Z axis from both experiments. It is
  recommended to use the files that have "improved" written, as these were
  measured from the second experiment.
